This dashboard focuses on discovery of 1996 United States demographic characteristics, filtering by gender and age range.  Two broad categories of data are analzed: professional and personal "metrics".

**Professional data** relates to information regarding employment status, occupation, and salary as well as education attainment.  The following visualizations are provided:

* *Occupation Distribution* - the relative distribution of occupations for the selected gender and age range.  The larger the pie slice, the greater representation that occupation has within the given demographic.

* *Work Arrangement Distribution* - the relative distribution of employment arrangements for the selected gender and age range.  Note that an employment arrangement is generally a description of an individual's employment status within a corporation, self-employed, employed within the commercial or government sector, etc.  The larger the pie slice, the greater representation that work arrangement has within the given demographic.

* *Mean Hours Worked per Week by Occupation* - the average (arithmetic mean) number of hours worked per week for the selected gender and age range and broken down by occupation.  The vertical axis displays the occupations represented in the selected dataset while the horizontal axis displays the mean hours worked for that occupation.

* *Maximum Educational Attainment* - the number of people in the selected gender and age range that topped out at the given education level.  The vertical axis displays the maximum level of education (ranging from Preschool to Doctorate) while the horizontal axis depicts the total number of people within the selected dataset who stopped at the given level of education.

**Personal data** considers marital status, country of origin, and race.  The following visualizations are provided:

* *Marital Status Distribution* - the relative distribution of relationship statuses for the selected gender and age range.  Note that marital status not only includes a binary indication of married/not-married, but also categories such as civil marriage, divorced, widowed, separated, and cases wherein the spouse has disappeared.  The larger the pie slice, the greater the representation of that marital status within the given demographic.

* *Native Country Distribution* - the relative distribution of people born in a given country for the selected gender and age range.  The larger the pie slice, the greater the representation of people born in that country within the given demographic.

* *Race Distribution* - the relative distribution of race/ethnicity for the selected gender and age range.  The larger the pie slice, the greater the representation of that race within the given demographic.
